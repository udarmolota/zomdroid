            <summary>Guide for Steam</summary>
            <div class="details-content">
                Zomdroid requires Project Zomboid files for Linux in order to run. If you're using
                Linux, simply download the game as usual through the Steam client. If you're using
                Windows or MacOS, follow these steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the Steam console. One way to do this is by typing <i>steam://open/console</i>
                        into your browser’s address bar
                    </li>
                    <li>Enter the following command: <i>download_depot 108600 108603</i>. This will
                        download the latest stable version of Project Zomboid for Linux. If you want
                        to download a specific version, you'll also need to provide a manifest id.
                        For example, to download the unstable version from March 24, 2025, use: <i>download_depot
                            108600 108603 2006259071304963476</i>. You can find a list of all
                        manifests on the <a href=https://steamdb.info/depot/108603/manifests/>SteamDB</a>
                        website (not affiliated with Steam or Valve).
                        <b>Steam only allows downloading manifests that belong to the currently active branch. For example, if you want to download files from the Build 42 branch, you must first opt into the Unstable branch in your Steam game's properties.</b>
                    </li>

        <h3>2. Add files to a .zip archive</h3>
        <p>Zomdroid requires the .zip archive to contain the game files at the top level — not inside a folder.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Guide for Steam</summary>
            <div class="details-content">
                Navigate to folder containing game files (folder with ProjectZomboid64 executable).
                On Linux it will most likely be located at <i>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid</i>.
                On Windows or macOS you need to note the depot download directory from the previous
                step (it will appear in the console once the download is finished). E.g. on Windows
                it is usually <i>C:\Program Files
                (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_108600\depot_108603\projectzomboid</i>. Select all
                files (Ctrl + A or Command + A on MacOS) and add them to a .zip archive
            </div>
        </details>
    </section>
    <section id="copy-archive-to-device">
        <h3>3. Copy the .zip archive to your mobile device</h3>
        Copy the .zip archive from the previous step to any folder on your mobile device. You can later use that file to create a new game instance. Once the game instance is created, you can delete the .zip archive to free up space.

<section id="native-libraries">
    <h2>Native libraries (Build 41 multiplayer)</h2>

    <p>
        To use multiplayer in <b>Build 41</b>, additional native libraries are required.
        These libraries are officially distributed by the Project Zomboid developers
        as part of <b>Build 42.12 (Linux version)</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only <b>two native libraries</b> are required:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>libRakNet64.so</code></li>
        <li><code>libZNetNoSteam64.so</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Download these files from the Linux Build 42.12 distribution,
        place both files into a single <code>.zip</code> archive,
        and upload this archive when creating a new game instance.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>.zip</code> archive should contain the two <code>.so</code> files
        at the top level (not inside a folder).
    </p>

    <p>
        You can upload the native libraries archive together with the main game files
        in the corresponding fields when creating a new game instance.
    </p>

<section id="renderers">
    <h2>Renderers and drivers</h2>

    <p>
        Zomdroid uses renderers to translate the desktop graphics of Project Zomboid
        into graphics compatible with Android devices.
    </p>

    <p>
        The launcher provides two rendering solutions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>GL4ES</b></li>
        <li><b>ZINK</b> (<code>ZINK_ZFA</code> / <code>ZINK_OSMESA</code>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GL4ES</h3>
    <p>
        GL4ES is the most stable renderer for <b>Build 41</b>.
        However, in <b>Build 42</b> it often produces graphical artifacts,
        as it cannot fully translate the updated rendering pipeline of the game.
    </p>

    <h3>ZINK</h3>
    <p>
        ZINK provides the best results with <b>Build 42</b>
        and usually eliminates the graphical artifacts seen with GL4ES.
    </p>

    <p>
        ZINK offers two Vulkan drivers:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>System Vulkan driver</b></li>
        <li><b>Freedreno (Turnip / Mesa)</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        ZINK primarily works on <b>Snapdragon devices (Adreno GPUs)</b>.
        On MediaTek (Helio, Dimensity) and other platforms
        (Exynos, Kirin, etc.), ZINK often does not work or may crash.
    </p>

    <p>
        The ideal configuration for both <b>Build 41</b> and <b>Build 42</b>
        is <b>ZINK + Freedreno</b>.
        However, Freedreno is supported only on certain Snapdragon devices
        with Adreno GPUs up to the 7xx series.
        Newer Snapdragon platforms (Elite / Gen 5) are not yet supported.
